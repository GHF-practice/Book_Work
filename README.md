Repo for all things books

I'm continually falling into the trap of creating a new repo for every book I start to work on, resulting in a massive glut of repos in various states of progress. 

Using this centralized repo for everything I can easily contribute and update the constantly expanding library of books.

### Python_for_DevOps - O'Reilly's book on effective automation
- This is a fantastic read.

### Beej's Guide to C 
- Excellent guide to C programming, very relatable examples and explanations.
